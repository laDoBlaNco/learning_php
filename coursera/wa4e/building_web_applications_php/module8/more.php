    <!-- submit itself can have a name and a value, but its different because this
     is th only one where the value is also what shows on the button. So one way not
     to have to remember and use button names in your code is to just check and see if
     it was pushed with 'isset()', then you don't have to worry what the value is 
     and it works since we typically look for the name, not the value -->
    <input type="submit" name="dopost" value="Submit">
    <!-- We can also override the behavior of a button that is more of a link than a button, meaning
     it'll take us somewhere else and it won't actually post anything since we tell
     it to 'return false' as if it was never pushed. -->
