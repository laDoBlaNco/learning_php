      // Again no rrcs are happening here. just generating dynamic HTML on
      // the front end. BUT THIS IS HOW WE DID IT IN THE OLD DAYS '95 to '05
      // but it got clunky and very large as we added more and more dynamics
      // jquery to the rescue. While the doms aren't portable, and direct DOM 
      // manipulation is a little clunky, there are a number of JS frameworks that 
      // handle the myriad of subtle differences between browswers for us '05 to '06

      // With JQuery, instead of manipulating the DOM, we let JQuery worry about it
      // We use JQuery functions and everything works much better.
