# learning_php

My path learning the PHP programming language. Though this seems a bit on the unorthodox 
side from what I'm seen on social networks until now, it seems like the best move.
This seems like it'll be my backdoor into the tech and SWE world. I will spend
some time learning PHP, the frameworks (Larvel, Symfony, etc) and Wordpress, 
just to see if I can get a position even if possibly just maintaining old codebases. 
The need is real, the marketshare is real, and unfortunately, the prejudice against PHP is also
very real.

## My Goals
My goals with this project is really just to learn php and see if I can start to use it
as my doorway into a secure job in tech. But at the same time see what I can hack in the language. 
It's not popular, and actually hated by some. This will also help me focus on Unix and Linux as
that's what 99% of my projects will be on (linux servers)

Though I'm just going through different videos and tutorials, I'm also adding in my thoughts to 
which helps me reason and understand about the language semantics.
