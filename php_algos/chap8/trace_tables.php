/**
 * Trace Tables
 * A trace table is a technique used to test algorithms or computer
 * programs/scripts for logic errors that occur while the algorithm
 * or program/script executes. 
 * 
 * The trace table simulates the flow of 
 * execution. Statements are executed step by step, and the values of
 * variables change as an assignment statement is executed. 
 * 
 * Trace tables are useful for educational purposes. They are typically
 * employed by novice programmers to help them visualize how a particular
 * algorithm or program works and to assist them in detecting logic
 * errors

 // Let's see a trace table in action. 
 $x = 10;
 $y = 15;
 $z = $x * $y;
 $z++;
 echo $z,"\n";

 // I'm not doing the exercise but I understand its about 
 // following the logic and figuring out the result on paper and
 // then testing the result.
