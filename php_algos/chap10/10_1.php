   * Sequence control structures refer to the line by line
   * execution by which statements are executed sequentially,
   * in the same order in which they appear in the script, without
   * skipping any of them. They might, for example, carry out
   * a series of read or write operations, arithmetic operations, 
   * or assignments to variables. 
   * 
   * The sequence control structure is the simplest of the 3 
   * fundamental control structures that I learned about in 4.11
   *    - Sequence Control Structure
   *    - Decision Control Structure
   *    - Loop Control Structure
   * 
   * ALL PROBLEMS IN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING CAN BE SOLVED USING
   * THESE THREE STRUCTURES.
